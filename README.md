# Hello and Welcome! 👋

I'm **Szymon Derlecki**, though you can call me **Simon** if you prefer! I've recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Data Analysis from the University of Łódź in Poland. Not one to settle, I've now embarked on a new academic adventure—pursuing a Master's in **Autonomous Systems** in Denmark. The transition has had its challenges, but I'm embracing them, as they’ve helped me discover strengths I didn't know I had!

## About Me

I'm a naturally curious and driven person. If something grabs my interest, I dive deep into it. My passion lies at the intersection of **creativity** and **engineering**, and I enjoy exploring this through different fields. Whether it’s **photography**, **music production**, or even keeping up with **military** and **automotive technologies**, I love how these areas blend both innovation and precision.

Beyond tech, I’m also an avid **sports enthusiast**, and I believe in living life to the fullest—staying active and engaged has always been my way to avoid "FOMO" later on!

## Tools & Technologies

Over the course of my studies, work experience, and personal projects, I've gained proficiency in a variety of tools, including:
